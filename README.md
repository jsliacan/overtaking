# overtaking

Python project with code analyzing overtaking distances.

The assumption is that the data are structured as shared, but `BikeLogs` folder is placed in `$(HOME)/Downloads`. If not the case, modify `constants.py` so that `DATA_HOME` variable is the expansion of the correct location. Use `~` for `$(HOME)` (user's home dir).

## Example
From date `20230112`.

Data from the box (classification: -1 oncoming, 1 overtaking, 0 didn't find any significant dip in lat distance). Same output can by obtained by running `python3 box.py`.
```

Data from the radar. Can be obtained by running `python3 radar.py`. Each timestamp stands for incremented radar counter.
